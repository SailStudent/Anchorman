# ANCHORMAN

## Getting started

Running this app is so easy a cave man could do it.
Here's a list of steps to complete if running from Windows.

### 1. Add all of the files from this repo to a local folder on your shared drive or desktop in a folder called "Weather_Slide". Ensure there is a sub-folder called "emoji_images" with all of the emojis inside it.

### 2. Open Anachonda Prompt and run the following commands
```
cd C:\Users\...\Weather_Slide
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r '.\requirements.txt'
streamlit run main.py
```
